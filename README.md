# Mark Krickovich
I'm Mark Krickovich, from California USA. I am a Data Science and Finance Professional.  I am passionate about Data-Prediction Sciences and All-Things Finance. I enjoy learning new Python and Data Science Skills everyday such as Pandas, Numpy, Neural Networks, and many other.  I am an experienced professional with a background in Business Valuation, Financial Planning & Analysis (FP&A), Complex Financial Modeling (in Excel and Python) and, beginning in 2018, Data Science.  I come to the Data Science field as a Finance Quant of sorts.  I am seeking challenging opportunities to work in the Data Science and Finance fields.  


## Skills and Experience
- Python for Data Science
- Supervised & Unsupervised Machine Learning
- Reinforcement Machine Learning
- Power BI
- MS Excel
- Financial Planning & Analysis

## Accredited Data Science Education
I recently completed a rigorous Data-Science Certification program through University of California, San Diego, which was awarded to me in March 2020 (see URL below). This learning expereince provides students with the skills to design, build, verify, and test predictive data models to make data-driven decisions in any industry. https://extension.ucsd.edu/courses-and-programs/data-mining-for-advanced-analytics
### Key Program Topics:
    - Model training, testing, and evaluation
    - Decision tables and trees
    - Classification rules
    - Association rules
    - Bayesian learning
    - Numeric prediction
